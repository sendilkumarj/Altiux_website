                    <h3 class="sectionh3 small-tsech3">How We Use Information We Collect About You</h3>
                    <p class="sectionp pless">We use non-personally identifiable information to analyze site usage (aggregated information about which pages were visited by our users) in order to improve the design and content of our website.</p>
                    <p class="sectionp pless">When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the purpose for the collection. We use personally identifiable information you provide only to respond to your inquiries or to register for programs and events that are sponsored by or co-sponsored by other organizations. Should you elect to register electronically for any such programs or events, we have no control over the third party sponsor's use of your information, as the privacy policy on our website will not apply.</p>
                    <p class="sectionp pless">Any information gathered by us may be shared, if appropriate, with any Altiux offices, affiliates and subsidiaries throughout the world. Personal information which users in the European Union provide to us may be transferred to other countries (including the United States). The data protection and privacy laws of such countries may differ from those of the European Union, and by providing your information to us, you expressly agree to such transfer</p>
                    <p class="sectionp pless">We will not contact you about other matters, unless you specifically request it, nor will we share, distribute or sell your personally identifiable information outside of Altiux and its affiliates and subsidiaries, except that Altiux may also share your information with third parties if we collect your information to register you for a company event or register for a newsletter and such third party must receive your information for registration purposes.</p>
                    <p class="sectionp pless">Whenever possible, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in" prior to receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we will require your affirmative consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.</p>
                    <p class="sectionp pless">If you apply for a job at Altiux, and submit a resume by e-mail or through our website, we will use the resume only for an internal application review process.</p>
                    <p class="sectionp pless">It is possible that we might be forced to disclose your personally identifiable information in response to legal process or when we believe in good faith such disclosure is required by law, such as in response to a court order, a law enforcement agency request, in response to a subpoena, or in response to an administrative agency's request.</p>
                    <p class="sectionp pless">Although we employ security measures to prevent unauthorized access to information we collect online, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. Specifically, we cannot guarantee the privacy of personal information you transmit over the web, or that may be collected in transit by third parties, including any consultants that provide services to us.</p>

                    <h3 class="sectionh3 small-tsech3">Collection of Information by Third Party Sites</h3>
                    <p class="sectionp pless">Like many other commercial websites, our site contains links to other sites whose information collection practices may be different than ours. Users should consult the other sites' privacy notices, as we do not have any control over any information that may be submitted to or collected by such third parties.</p>

                    <h3 class="sectionh3 small-tsech3">Cookies</h3>
                    <p class="sectionp pless">A cookie is a text-only string of information that a website transfers to the “cookies” file of the browser on your computer's hard disk in order that the website can remember you when you return for another visit to the site. A cookie contains the name of the domain from which the cookie originated, how long the cookie will remain active, and a randomly generated unique number to track pages you have visited. Every time you visit our site, we send you a cookie in order to track traffic to our site. Cookies may be used to enable the personalization features of our site (you can recall recently-viewed pages, and have information that you have previously provided be filled in automatically instead of having to fill in registration questionnaires every time), and to compile anonymous aggregate data that allow us to determine how visitors use our site and help us improve our offerings on the website. We may use session cookies (temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave the site) and persistent cookies (remain in your browser for a longer period of time, depending on the “lifetime” of the cookie) on this website.</p>
                    <p class="sectionp pless">If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our website, you have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser, although you may not be able to take full advantage of the Altiux website if you do so. In particular, you may be required to accept cookies in order to complete certain actions on our website. You do not need to have cookies turned on, however, to use/navigate through many parts of our website, except access to certain of Altiux's web pages that require a login and password.</p>

                    <p class="sectionp pless">We reserve the right to amend this policy or any part of it from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will make that information available by posting a notice on this site or updating this policy. Please review the policy periodically for changes.</p>
